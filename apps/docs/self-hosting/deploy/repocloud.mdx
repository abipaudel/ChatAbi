# Deploy Typebot on RepoCloud

Typebot is an open-source chatbot builder that you can easily deploy and manage. With RepoCloud, you can deploy Typebot with just one click. Follow the steps below to get started.

<Note>
  The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed
  service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). You'll have high availability,
  backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste,
  Typebot's founder. The cloud version can save a substantial amount of
  developer time and resources. For most sites, this ends up being the best value
  option, and the revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development
  of Typebot. So you'll be supporting open source software and getting a great
  service!
